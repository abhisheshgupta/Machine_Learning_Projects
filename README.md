Introduction-
This repository contain some machine learning projects.
these projects are-
1.Car_Price_Prediction
2.Gemstone_Price_prediction
3.Sales_Transactions_Clustering
4.Steller_Classification

Desciption of the Projects-
1.Car_Price_Prediction-
This is a regression project.In this project we have to
predict car prices based on the input features.I am using
linear regression,svm and decision tree algorithm in this
project.

2.Gemstone_Price_Prediction-
This is also a regression problem.In this project we have
predict prices of gemstone.I am using linear regression
in this project.

3.Sales_Transactions_Clustering-
This is a clustering project.In this project we have to 
group data into different clusters.I am using k-means 
clustering for this project.

4.Steller_Classification-
This is a classification project.In this project we hame
to predict label of target class.I am using logistic
regression,svm and decision tree for this project.
